# FA23-Virtual-Language-Learning
## Application Description
Our application is a fully immersive, Virtual Reality environment designed to teach users Spanish. Previous works have either studied language learning in VR using task completion, or language learning in a real-world kitchen, but there remains a need for language learning by task completion in virtual reality. Initially, users are given a pre-screening, about what they would like to see in a virtual app, compared to traditional applications such as Duolingo. Afterwards, they are brought into a novel VR kitchen, and allowed to learn the controls of the system, by manipulating oranges, and enjoying a "free play mode". Once users are ready, they are given a quizlet test, where they memorize key words in spanish. Finally, users are brought back into the VR environment, to complete a task of cooking fajitas, with a recipe entirely written in Spanish. Users then create the fajitas, by cleaning and cutting vegetables, cooking fish and adding cheese, among other tasks.

Our application features:
* A unique kitchen environment designed in Unity
* Assets designed in blender
* Fully immersive controls utilizing the Valve Index
* A comprehensive recipe that is easy to follow
* Enjoyable interactions that make learning fun

## Installation Instructions
### Software Requirements
To install our project you will need Unity version: 2022.3.13f1. Along with this, you will need the most recent Microsoft Visual Studio insallation.

### Hardware Requirements
For our project you will need:
* Valve Index headset (HPC Vive may work)
* 2 knuckles controllers (typically comes with the headset)
* A minimum of 2 basestations for tracking (4 is the optimal setup)
* 1 Computer with a GPU, and display port

Once all requirements are met, you can pull the GitHub at the provided link in this document. To run the applicaiton you can load the repository as a new project in Unity. Once successfully loaded, you may either hit the "play button" in Unity to do a quick port to the headset, or do a full build. Both options will automatically launch to the Headset.
